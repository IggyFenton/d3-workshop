# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

This is a lightweight Node/Express app which provides a nice sketchpad for playing around with d3.js. 

You'll need:
- node: https://nodejs.org/en/
- gulp: `npm install gulp -g`

## To Run
1. `cd src` then use `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. `gulp serve` will start server/app.js and browser-sync. This will launch a browser pointing to the start of the lecture. 

# Using the D3 Sketchpad
The relevant javascript you will want to look at to follow along is located in: src/wwwroot/js/

It is designed for rapid prototyping. For example you can add a timeseries5.js to src/wwwroot/js and use d3. Your script will be immediately available at the route: http://localhost:3000/timeseries/5.
